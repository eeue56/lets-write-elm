## Goals

- Understand Elm's syntax
- Take a look at examples views
- Learn how elm-test works
- Fix some broken code

## Go install Elm 

If you haven't installed Elm previously, you should install Elm now. The easiest way to install Elm is via `npm`. We're also going to be using elm-test in order to run our tests.

```
npm install -g elm elm-test elm-format
```

If you don't have npm, I suggest you get it.
