## Go install Elm 

If you haven't installed Elm previously, you should install Elm now. The easiest way to install Elm is via `npm`. We're also going to be using elm-test in order to run our tests.

```
npm install -g elm elm-test elm-format
```

If you don't have npm


## Minimal Elm program

The smallest Elm program is just a plain old HTML text string.

```elm
-- import the Html module
import Html 

-- 
main = Html.text "Hello world!"
```

## Now what?

Run elm-test and get fixing things!
